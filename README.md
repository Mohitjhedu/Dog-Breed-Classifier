# Dog Breed Classifier

Welcome to the **Dog Breed Classifier** project! This project is an attempt to classify over 100 different dog breeds using deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and ResNet. The current version of the model achieves an accuracy of 60% on validation data.


## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a model that can identify various dog breeds from images with high accuracy. As of now, the model has been trained on a dataset of over 100 dog breeds and achieves 60% accuracy on validation data.

We are aware that there is room for improvement, and we are continuously working on enhancing the model's performance. Future updates will focus on advanced CNN techniques and fine-tuning to improve accuracy to around 80-90%.

## Kaggle Notebook

You can explore the complete code and workflow in our [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohitjhedu/practice-1). The notebook provides detailed insights into the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process. We encourage you to check it out and share any ideas or approaches you may have to improve the model's performance.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Approach**: We have used CNN, ANN, and ResNet models to classify dog breeds.
- **Extensive Dataset**: The model is trained on a dataset containing images of over 100 dog breeds.
- **60% Validation Accuracy**: Our model currently achieves 60% accuracy on the validation set, with plans for improvement.

## Future Enhancements

We recognize the potential of this project and have several enhancements planned:

- **Advanced CNN Techniques**: Implementing advanced techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and more complex architectures.
- **Improved Data Collection**: Expanding the dataset with more diverse images to improve the model's ability to generalize.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
- **Model Ensembling**: Combining multiple models to increase accuracy.
